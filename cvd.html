                    <h2>Summary and Motivations</h2>
                    <p>This project is officialy titled "Unlocking the Potential of Mobile ECG Devices: A Training App
                        for Community Health Workers".
                        It addresses the critical need for comprehensive ECG training among volunteer health workers
                        (commonly known as ASHAs, or
                        Accredited Social Health Activists) in rural areas of India.
                        <br>
                        Currently, ASHAs are equipped with KardiaMobile devices. These are portable, bluetooth-enabled
                        6-lead
                        ECG devices. ASHAs can use these devices to take ECGs, but lack the training to interpret ECG
                        results. This leads to delays in
                        diagnosis and treatment while waiting for results to be interpreted. <br>

                        The motivation behind the project stems from the desire to empower ASHAs with the necessary
                        skills to interpret
                        ECGs, thereby improving patient care and health outcomes in resource-constrained environments.
                        <br> <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Empowerment:</strong> The app aims to empower community health workers with the
                            skills and knowledge to interpret ECGs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Patient Outcomes:</strong> By providing comprehensive ECG training,
                            diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular conditions in rural settings can be expedited,
                            ultimately leading to improved health outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Perspective:</strong> Through user-centered design and iterative
                            development, the app is tailored to the needs and preferences of its users, maximizing
                            usability and user satisfaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Project Management Perspective:</strong> Utilizing a structured development process
                            including research, prototyping, and testing, this project delivered a high-quality training
                            app within the specified timeline and requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Application Flow</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Welcome Screen:</strong>
                    <p>Upon launching the app for the first time, users are greeted with a welcome screen where they can
                        enter their name. The app then greets them personally, enhancing user engagement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. Home Screen:</strong>
                    <p>After entering their name, users are directed to the home screen where they can access different
                        modules and features of the app.
                        Users can select from a range of modules covering various aspects of ECG interpretation, each
                        offering progressive learning content.
                        Modules are sequential and unlock after the completion of the previous module. This approach
                        provides a logical progression in learning,
                        allowing users to build upon their understanding gradually.</p>
                    </p>

                    <strong>3. Lesson Screen:</strong>
                    <p>Lesson interfaces reside here. Each module presents a lesson using text, audio recordings, and
                        images. At the end of the lesson users
                        can proceed to practice sessions.
                    </p>

                    <strong>4. Practice Screen:</strong>
                    <p>Users engage in practice sessions to reinforce their understanding of ECG interpretation, with
                        immediate feedback provided for each question.
                        Questions are dynamically generated for effective, non-repetitive practice capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>5. Dictionary and Help:</strong>
                    <p>Accessible from the home screen, users can utilize a searchable dictionary and help menu to
                        clarify any terminology or navigate through the app.
                        They are able to reset the application as well as change the language between Hindi and English.
                    </p>
