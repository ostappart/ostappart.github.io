                    <h2>Summmary and Motivations</h2>
                    <p>The Life Cycle of Fashion offers an interactive exploration of environmental impacts resulting
                        from clothing
                        through its "life cycle": production, maintenance, and disposal. The site serves as an
                        educational platform
                        featuring interactive, explorable visualizations. <br><br> <strong>Identified
                            stakeholders</strong> were end users and viewers of the page,
                        whose engagement and satisfaction are important for achieving the end goals and outcomes.
                        <br><br> <Strong>Key motivations</Strong> were to
                        increase understanding among shoppers about how their clothing consumption affects our
                        environment, and empower
                        them to make educated decisions about their wardrobes.

                the country and a number as the mouse cursor hovers. The cursor clicks and drags a slider representing the years passing, and the countries change 
                to other shades of green." class="project-phase-image" />

                    <h2>Development Process</h2>
                    <p>In the planning stages it was decided to choose a set of <strong>design approaches</strong>
                        to focus efforts on the defined stakeholders, the end user and general public.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>User-Centered Design</li>
                        <li>Incorporate Data Visualization Best Practices</li>
                        <li>Add Interactivity</li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By following these design approaches the website includes a variety of interactive
                        visualizations.
                        Appropriate color schemes include contrast and minimize biases present with colors such as red
                        and yellow.
                        Interactivity includes zooming, tooltip implementation, and draggable sliders.

                    <p>
                        The components functioned as expected and added great visual detail to the site. Getting an
                        entire globe functioning was quite difficult,
                        and finding a functional color scheme was also difficult. I wanted to choose one reminiscent of
                        the environtment and water,
                        but would also allow for easily discerning between different components of the graph. The
                        objectives were met and user feedback was excellent.
                        <br><br>
                        Future areas of improvement include moving the visualizations to their own distinct webpages and
                        expounding upon the details already there.
                        Expansions also could potentially include information specific to different clothing items and
                        accessories, such as purses, belts, and shoes.
